# Onfido SDK Integration with Node.js

This repository serves as a simple demonstration of how to integrate the Onfido SDK with a Node.js server.

# Overview
The demonstration shows basic functionalities such as:

- Collecting user information through a simple form to create an Applicant ID.
- Use the ApplicantId to obtain an SDK Token
- Initializing the Onfido SDK with an SDK token.
- Displaying Document and Media IDs on the screen once the Onfido verification process is complete.

# What to ignore
- Ignore the poor CSS

*I'll potentially come back with some updates later on :)*
